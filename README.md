# UOPS-E2EE: Unicode-Obscured Pre-Shared Key End-to-End Encryption with StegoKey and Out-of-Band Delivery

---

## Status: Conceptual & Under Development

This repository outlines the conceptual framework for **UOPS-E2EE**, a highly secure communication model and a planned Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge. It explores extreme security constraints where no encryption keys are ever exchanged during runtime.

---

## Core Concepts

UOPS-E2EE is designed around a multi-layered approach to digital concealment and encryption:

1.  **Pre-Shared Keys (PSK) Paradigm:** All decryption relies solely on keys that are "pre-shared"—meaning both client and server possess the necessary key material *before* any communication occurs. No key negotiation, exchange, or transmission happens over the wire.

2.  **StegoKey for Key Reconstruction:** Decryption keys aren't stored directly in plain sight. Instead, they're reconstructed from fragments meticulously hidden using **steganography**. These fragments are embedded within innocuous-looking public media or directories (e.g., hidden within an `/icons/` folder, embedded in an image file via LSB encoding, or disguised in metadata).

3.  **Unicode-Obscured Server Paths:** Server endpoints are camouflaged using sophisticated Unicode manipulation. This involves leveraging zero-width characters, homoglyphs, and other Unicode tricks to make server routes appear benign or common, effectively cloaking the true paths from typical enumeration and fuzzing tools.

4.  **Strong Symmetric Encryption:** The entire communication pipeline is secured with robust symmetric encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256, ChaCha20). Data is encrypted on the client-side *before* transmission and decrypted on the server-side using its internal copy of the pre-shared key.

5.  **No Key Transmission:** A fundamental principle: at no point are keys transmitted, requested, or exchanged, rendering the communication channel opaque to interception or man-in-the-middle attacks, even if the channel itself is compromised.

6.  **Binary-Only Distribution & Obfuscation:** Both the frontend client and backend server are intended for distribution in binary-only form. The frontend's internals will be further obfuscated to resist static and dynamic analysis, adding another layer of challenge for reverse engineering.

7.  **Isolated Environment:** The system is designed to operate in a highly controlled, localized environment, typically bound to `localhost` with no external network access, simulating an high-security deployment.

## Purpose

The primary goal of UOPS-E2EE is to serve as:

* A **conceptual framework** for exploring advanced techniques in secure communication, combining encryption, steganography, and software obfuscation.
* A challenging **Capture The Flag (CTF)** scenario, pushing participants to think outside the box, analyze deeply obfuscated binaries, understand complex steganographic techniques, and navigate Unicode-based deception.
