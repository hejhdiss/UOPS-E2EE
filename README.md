# UOPS-E2EE: Unicode-Obscured Pre-Shared Key End-to-End Encryption with StegoKey and Out-of-Band Delivery

---

## Status: Conceptual & Under Development

This repository outlines the conceptual framework for **UOPS-E2EE**, a highly secure communication model and a planned Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge. It explores extreme security constraints where no encryption keys are ever exchanged during runtime.

---

## Core Concepts

UOPS-E2EE is designed around a multi-layered approach to digital concealment and encryption:

1.  **Pre-Shared Keys (PSK) Paradigm:** All decryption relies solely on keys that are "pre-shared"—meaning both client and server possess the necessary key material *before* any communication occurs. No key negotiation, exchange, or transmission happens over the wire.

2.  **StegoKey for Key Reconstruction:** Decryption keys aren't stored directly in plain sight. Instead, they're reconstructed from fragments meticulously hidden using **steganography**. These fragments are embedded within innocuous-looking public media or directories (e.g., hidden within an `/icons/` folder, embedded in an image file via LSB encoding, or disguised in metadata).

3.  **Unicode-Obscured Server Paths:** Server endpoints are camouflaged using sophisticated Unicode manipulation. This involves leveraging zero-width characters, homoglyphs, and other Unicode tricks to make server routes appear benign or common, effectively cloaking the true paths from typical enumeration and fuzzing tools.

4.  **Strong Symmetric Encryption:** The entire communication pipeline is secured with robust symmetric encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256, ChaCha20). Data is encrypted on the client-side *before* transmission and decrypted on the server-side using its internal copy of the pre-shared key.

5.  **No Key Transmission:** A fundamental principle: at no point are keys transmitted, requested, or exchanged, rendering the communication channel opaque to interception or man-in-the-middle attacks, even if the channel itself is compromised.

6.  **Binary-Only Distribution & Obfuscation:** Both the frontend client and backend server are intended for distribution in binary-only form. The frontend's internals will be further obfuscated to resist static and dynamic analysis, adding another layer of challenge for reverse engineering.

7.  **Isolated Environment:** The system is designed to operate in a highly controlled, localized environment, typically bound to `localhost` with no external network access, simulating an high-security deployment.

## Purpose

The primary goal of UOPS-E2EE is to serve as:

* A **conceptual framework** for exploring advanced techniques in secure communication, combining encryption, steganography, and software obfuscation.
* A challenging **Capture The Flag (CTF)** scenario, pushing participants to think outside the box, analyze deeply obfuscated binaries, understand complex steganographic techniques, and navigate Unicode-based deception.

## Steganography Implementation Details and Future Enhancements

The provided `inject.py` script serves as a **sample implementation** for the steganography usage in the base version of UOPS-E2EE. It demonstrates how secrets (flag and XOR key) are appended to image files with magic strings.

Future enhancements to the steganography methods are planned across different versions:

### Version Planning: Security Enhancements

#### Security v1.0.0
This release will focus on making the embedded data significantly harder to identify and extract:
* **Advanced Encoding:** Stored data within the steganographic files will be further encoded (e.g., using Base64, custom obfuscation, or other cryptographic techniques) *before* embedding.
* **Decoy Structural Identicality:** All flag and key-containing PNG files, including decoys, will be designed to be structurally identical or begin with an identical structure. For instance, if a real key is `12345` and it's Base64 encoded to `MTIzNDU=`, then both genuine and decoy files might save content in the format `#KEYFLAG#{a_content}`. The `{a_content}` will vary, but only the creator (or the released binary) will possess the logic to differentiate between actual data and decoy content, making it much harder to simply extract based on format. This ensures that all decoys appear to contain valid-looking (but meaningless) "secret" content.

#### Security v1.1.2
Building upon `v1.0.0`, this release will introduce an additional layer of obfuscation:
* **Dual Encoding:** Data will be encoded using one method and then re-encoded using another, distinct method. This layered encoding ensures that only the binary (or its creator) will possess the precise knowledge and sequence of decoding steps required to extract the true secret, significantly increasing the complexity for reverse engineering and data extraction.

#### Security v1.3.0
This version will introduce highly advanced, dynamic steganography techniques:
* **Polymorphic Steganography:** The steganographic embedding method itself will become variable. Instead of a fixed algorithm (e.g., LSB), the embedding technique (e.g., embedding in pixel data, metadata, or file structure) could change, potentially even on a per-file or per-session basis, determined by a hidden parameter or an algorithm known only to the binary.
* **Dynamic Key Fragment Placement:** The location and number of key fragments will no longer be static. A sophisticated algorithm, derived from a master key or derived at runtime, will determine which icons (or other media) contain parts of the key and where within those files they are embedded. This adds another layer of dynamic challenge, preventing static analysis from pinpointing secret locations.

#### Security v1.5.6
This version will introduce an advanced network architecture for enhanced resilience and privacy:
* **Intermediate Server Support (Non-Decrypting):** An intermediate server will be introduced between the client and the final backend. Crucially, this server will *not* have access to any decryption keys and will therefore never see the unencrypted content. Its role will be to perform security-enhancing functions on the encrypted traffic.
* **Encrypted Traffic Transformation:** The intermediate server will implement obfuscation and transformation techniques on the *already encrypted* data stream. This could include:
    * **Traffic Padding & Randomization:** Adding random bytes or dummy packets to obscure actual data transfer patterns and sizes.
    * **Protocol Obfuscation:** Rerouting or disguising the communication to appear as common, innocuous network traffic (e.g., DNS, HTTPS to a common service), further hindering traffic analysis.
    * **Rate Limiting & Anti-DDoS:** Basic network-level protections that do not require content inspection.
    This approach provides an additional layer of security by making traffic analysis and interception more difficult, without compromising the end-to-end encryption.
